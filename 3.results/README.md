# Output results

This folder contains auto-generated figures and tables. Since these are automatically overwritten by the notebooks and scripts, don't put anything in here that you want to keep!

The subfolders contain

* `observables_fig`: each observable, plotted separately
* `summary_fig`: multiple subplots, giving several different related observables
* `analysis_fig`: figures corresponding to more advanced analysis (i.e. curve fitting, etc)
* `tables`: tables of validation and fit coefficients
* `test_fig`: auto-generated figures made by the test routines. Ignore these, unless you're trying to develop your own plotting routines.
